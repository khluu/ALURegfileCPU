# ALURegfileCPU
CPU Hardware Design

In this project we will be using Logisim to implement a simple 32-bit two-cycle processor. Throughout the implementation of this project, we'll be making design choices that make it compatible with machine code outputs from MARS and our Project 2! When we're done, we'll be able to run most, but not all, instances of MIPS code through your assembler and linker, and then on our very own CPU!

In part I, we will make the Regfile and ALU.
In part II, we will complete a 2-stage pipelined processor.
